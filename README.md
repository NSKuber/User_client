# User_client

The transaction-generating client part of my educational Blockchain project coded with school students at SESC NSU. 
Creates transactions and sends them over to the server. So far was tested only for connections over local network.

Usage: filename.exe <IP address of the server>

Example for testing on one machine: User_client.exe 127.0.0.1
